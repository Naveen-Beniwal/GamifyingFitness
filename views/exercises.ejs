      Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India over 5,000 years ago.
      It combines physical postures, breath control, meditation, and ethical
      principles to promote overall well-being. The word "yoga" comes from the
      Sanskrit root "yuj," which means "to unite" or "to join," reflecting the
      practice's goal of uniting the body, mind, and spirit. Types of Yoga:
      Hatha Yoga: Focuses on physical postures (asanas) and breath control
      (pranayama). It is often a gentle introduction to the practice. Vinyasa
      Yoga: Emphasizes fluid movement and synchronization of breath with
      movement, often in a dynamic sequence. Ashtanga Yoga: A rigorous style
      involving a set sequence of postures and a specific breathing technique.
      Iyengar Yoga: Focuses on precise alignment and the use of props to help
      practitioners achieve correct posture. Bikram Yoga: Consists of a series
      of 26 postures practiced in a heated room to promote flexibility and
      detoxification. Benefits of Yoga: Physical: Enhances flexibility,
      strength, balance, and posture. It can also improve cardiovascular health
      and aid in weight management. Mental: Reduces stress, anxiety, and
      depression. It promotes relaxation and mental clarity. Emotional:
      Encourages a positive outlook and emotional resilience. It helps in
      developing mindfulness and self-awareness. Key Concepts: Asanas: Physical
      postures that improve strength and flexibility. Pranayama: Breathing
      exercises that regulate the flow of prana (life energy) in the body.
      Meditation: Practices that cultivate mental focus and inner peace. Yamas
      and Niyamas: Ethical guidelines and personal observances that guide
      behavior and self-discipline. Yoga is practiced worldwide and can be
      adapted to various fitness levels and preferences, making it a versatile
      tool for enhancing overall health and well-being.
